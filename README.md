# The Vault
This vault is an Aptos smart contract with its own wallet, to which you can send your funds to.  
Only you will be able to access those funds. You can also decide to allocate it to other people if you want.  

## What's the point of this?
Since this smart contract has it's own wallet, you can have multiple fund storages linked to a single wallet of yours, which means you wouldn't have to deal with multiple wallets and seed phrases. And this smart contract allows allocation, where you can allocate a set amount of funds to wallets of your choice, who can then make a request to this smart contract to get their allocated funds. This is synonymous with a bank cheque, where you only lose your funds when the recipient cashes out their cheque, and till that happens, you have control of your funds. This is much better than sending them the funds outright and losing all control of it, in some cases.
